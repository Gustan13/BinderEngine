# BinderEngine
The BinderEngine is an open source 3D game engine created for a specific video game currently in development.
It currently has basic phong shading support, skeletal animation (without position interpolation) and texturing.

The engine will focus on optimizing collisions using BSP trees and interior worlds to explore.
The base engine will also eventually have a simple editor to change the layout of the game being made and future similiar games.
